# stack-maze
This project was completed Fall 2018

This was an assignment completed for Advanced Data Structure & Algorithm. The purpose of this assignment was to implement a stack data structure that can complete a maze (or not). The number 1 are walls while the number 0 is a path. A user may type in a start position using x,y 
coordinates and the algorithm will attempt to solve the maze. It will let the user know if it successfully escaped the maze or not.
